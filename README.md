# week2-TimeForce

We are Time Force and we're building a stopwatch using TDD.


<b>User Story 1</b>: As a ranger wanting to accurately predict how long a coding task takes to complete, I want to time how long I have been working on a task, so that in the future I know how much time to estimate.

<br>

<b>Specs and issues:

- [ ] Ranger presses <B>START</B> button, in order to start the timer

- [ ] Ranger presses <B>STOP</B> button, in order to stop the timer

- [ ] Ranger presses <B>RESET</B> button, in order to reset the timer and reset the displayed time to 00:00:00:00

- [ ] Ranger can see the timer's current time in hours, seconds, minutes and milliseconds

<br>

<b>Stretch goals:</b>

- [ ] Adding a new user story.

  User Story 2: A chef would like to have a different countdown timer for each pan that happens to be on the cooker or in the oven.
